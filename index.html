    <h1>One Pot Chicken and Vegetables with Leftovers</h1>
    <section>
      <p>I've written about a variation of this <a href="http://novegetarians.blogspot.com/2011/04/chicken-potatoes-grape-tomatoes-and.html">recipe</a> before.
      It’s a great example of a recipe versatile enough to use whatever vegetables are available that look good, and are priced right.
      Or, to simply to use up leftover vegetables hanging around the fridge.
      Barbara Kafka wrote a wonderful book called Roasting, a Simple Art, wherein she talks about the concept of the continuous kitchen.
      I love this. To me, it means cooking every day and using fresh ingredients without waste.
      Always using what was left over from the previous few days and reinterpreting the ingredient to ensure your palate doesn't get bored.
      </p>
        <article>You know that thing? Where the only way a given vegetable
          is available is in a quantity that you would never use?
          Celery for example, as just one lady, I am not eating that
          entire bunch of celery before it goes rubbery. I only need ¼
          cup diced celery for a given recipe, why do I have to buy
          so much? (Okay, I know you can buy individual stalks, but you
          get my drift, right? <i>RIGHT</i>?) A continuous kitchen addresses
          this very dilemma. If I plan ahead I can use that celery
          in a mirepoix one night and plan to make a chicken stock
          and celery soup later in the week. Then freeze both into
          portion sizes. No waste=pennies saved=more fresh nutritious
          food at the ready.
        </article>
      <p>This comes together in about 15-20 minutes,
        and then roasts for about another 30 minutes.
        It will yield enough for two full meals and chicken leftovers
        for sandwiches, salad, tacos, posole, <a href="http://novegetarians.blogspot.com/2011/04/poblanos-stuffed-with-shrimp-corn-and.html">stuffed poblanos</a>, <a href="http://novegetarians.blogspot.com/2011/03/black-bean-chicken-chili-and-stockand.html">chili</a>,
        having something to pick on standing in front of the fridge at
        11 o’clock at night, bones for a small batch of stock….the
        list goes on and on.

        <u><strong>Ingredients</strong></u>
          <ul>
            <li>A few chicken parts. I used two bone in, skin on breast
            pieces here
            <li>2 medium portobellos, or other mushrooms
            <li>6-10 new/tiny Yukon gold potatoes, sized or cut to about
            ¾ inch pieces
            <li>2 rosemary sprigs
            <li>½ lemon
            <li>A few garlic cloves
            <li>Olive oil, salt, pepper
          </ul>
        <br>
        <u><strong>Implements</strong></u>
          <ul>
            <li>Sauce pan to par boil the potatoes
            <li>Roasting pan or pot large enough to hold all ingredients
              with the chicken in a single layer
            <li>Colander
            <li>Mixing bowl
          </ul>

      <p>Pre-heat the oven to 450 degrees. Put the sauce pan on to
        boil with enough water to cover your potatoes. Put the
        roasting pan to heat to medium/medium high on another
        burner. Wash the potatoes and use a vegetable peeler to
        remove any gross bits or eyes. Remove the ribs from the
        mushrooms by scraping with a spoon and cut the stems.
        Slice them. Remove the skins from the garlic cloves,
        leaving them whole, and cut the ½ lemon into very thin slices. When the
        water is boiling, add your potatoes.

      <p>Unwrap the chicken parts, pat the skin side dry with a
        paper towel and salt and pepper them right there in the
        packaging, no need to create extra cleanup by putting the
        raw meat on your counter or cutting board. Add the chicken to the
        heated roasting pan skin side down.
      </p>
      <p>Space out for a couple minutes.
      </p>
      <p>Return to the kitchen.
      </p>
      <p>Drain the potatoes. Flip the chicken and turn off the heat.
        Mix the mushrooms, potatoes and garlic cloves together in a
        bowl with a bit of olive oil, salt and pepper.
        Pour them over the chicken then add the rosemary sprigs
        and lemon slices.
