    <h1>One Pot Chicken and Vegetables with Leftovers</h1>
    <p>I've written about a variation of this <a href="http://novegetarians.blogspot.com/2011/04/chicken-potatoes-grape-tomatoes-and.html">recipe</a> before.
      Itâ€™s a great example of a recipe versatile enough to use whatever vegetables are available that look good, and are priced right.
      Or, to simply to use up leftover vegetables hanging around the fridge.
      Barbara Kafka wrote a wonderful book called Roasting, a Simple Art, wherein she talks about the concept of the continuous kitchen.
      I love this. To me, it means cooking every day and using fresh ingredients without waste.
      Always using what was left over from the previous few days and reinterpreting the ingredient to ensure your palate doesn't get bored.
