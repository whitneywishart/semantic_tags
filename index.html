    <h1>One Pot Chicken and Vegetables with Leftovers</h1>
    <section>
      <p>I've written about a variation of this <a href="http://novegetarians.blogspot.com/2011/04/chicken-potatoes-grape-tomatoes-and.html">recipe</a> before.
      It’s a great example of a recipe versatile enough to use whatever vegetables are available that look good, and are priced right.
      Or, to simply to use up leftover vegetables hanging around the fridge.
      Barbara Kafka wrote a wonderful book called Roasting, a Simple Art, wherein she talks about the concept of the continuous kitchen.
      I love this. To me, it means cooking every day and using fresh ingredients without waste.
      Always using what was left over from the previous few days and reinterpreting the ingredient to ensure your palate doesn't get bored.

        <article>You know that thing? Where the only way a given vegetable
          is available is in a quantity that you would never use?
          Celery for example, as just one lady, I am not eating that
          entire bunch of celery before it goes rubbery. I only need ¼
          cup diced celery for a given recipe, why do I have to buy
          so much? (Okay, I know you can buy individual stalks, but you
          get my drift, right? <i>RIGHT</i>?) A continuous kitchen addresses
          this very dilemma. If I plan ahead I can use that celery
          in a mirepoix one night and plan to make a chicken stock
          and celery soup later in the week. Then freeze both into
          portion sizes. No waste=pennies saved=more fresh nutritious
          food at the ready.
        </article>
      <p>This comes together in about 15-20 minutes,
        and then roasts for about another 30 minutes.
        It will yield enough for two full meals and chicken leftovers
        for sandwiches, salad, tacos, posole, <a href="http://novegetarians.blogspot.com/2011/04/poblanos-stuffed-with-shrimp-corn-and.html">stuffed poblanos</a>, <a href="http://novegetarians.blogspot.com/2011/03/black-bean-chicken-chili-and-stockand.html">chili</a>,
        having something to pick on standing in front of the fridge at
        11 o’clock at night, bones for a small batch of stock….the
        list goes on and on.
